              "\"Review0: Review: Rude and obnoxious Tried to charge my card without my permission after I had already paid my bill mind you. Now due to their own error I have to send it Western Union. They refuse to have a discussion about it. No wonder everyone complains about them.\\n\\nReview1: Review: I would give them no stars if available!   Lately we are getting 2 or more bills a month from them.   I called and of course, did not get an English speaking person.   They stated that they are getting caught up on the wrong billing issues they were having previously.   Not happy at all with PPL any longer.   They used to be the best, now they are the worst!!!!!!!!!!!   Do NOT recommend them at all.\\n\\nReview2: Review: Worse company ever.  They seems incompetent of fixing customer's problems and concerns. I haven't gotten a bill since January but yet still money are still being charged with no end cycle. Been trying to contact them but no one seems to can tell you something logical\\n\\nReview3: Review: I sent in ID to start service via email. Don't ever send an email because it is not maintained or checked (a customer service representative advised)!!!! Our service was shut off so I called and it went to a call center in India. The rep said our documents were received and our electric would be turned back on shortly. Never turned on. Called the next day and the rep said the ID cannot be emailed it must be faxed or mailed. JOIN THE 21st CENTURY PPL!!! She then indicated it would only be 2 hours until it would be turned back on. Called back and spoke with a different person and they said that timeframe is wrong. After I faxed the document , I called back in an hour and they still had not confirmed they received anything !!  Are they working with dot matrix printers as well?!? WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!\\n\\nReview4: Review: The person in charge of customer service should be immediately terminated.  PP&L provides the absolute worst customer service of any company that I have dealt with in 50 years.  Ordered service on January 31, was turned on and two days later turned off.  Called again, waited 84 minutes for an agent, was told it was turned on immediately, it was not, called again, waited 91 minutes for an agent, was told it will be turned on, that day, it was not.  Called again, waited 72 minutes for an agent, was told it will be turned on tomorrow.  Now 6 days later still no service\\n\\nReview5: Review: Following a move to Pennsylvania (Poconos), I opened an account with PPL. Since I was a new customer I was told I would have to pay a security deposit of $444, but after one year of paying bills on time that money would be used toward future bills. Well it has been 14 months, with an excellent payment record and I keep getting billed. I've tried calling three times to remedy this and each time I have waited over 30 minutes on hold with no one answering. One other time a rep picked up in record time, but transferred me to Billing, where again I waited 30 minutes with no one answering.The only way to contact this company is by phone (really - 30 minutes waiting and no one picking up), or by letter.

My next move will be lodging a complaint with the BBB and the governor's office.\\n\\nReview6: Review: Reading the prior reviews of this organization is mind-numbing, because they're not only just awful and likely shared by most of PPL's customers, but also because they clearly haven't cleaned up their act despite the rancor from their customers. This is the last place I should be reviewing a power service, but the utilities sector has completely hijacked the pandemic and has decided that its vulnerable customers, many who have been to struggle financially due to lockdowns, should take it up the keister.I've been a customer for over 15 years, and these previous reviews are all spot-on: terrible customer service, shocking bills, and frequent outages that, at least in my PA town, are never less than 8 hours, sometimes days. Their programs to help are insulting, inefficient, and you probably won't qualify in the first place.PPL's a monopoly, despite throwing a bone to smaller companies who are forced to use their equipment. I actually go with a third party company and dealing with them is far easier, but they don't have much hand. PPL has made, and will continue to make, out like the bandits they are during the toughest socioeconomic disaster in the history of the majority of their customers.\\n\\nReview7: Review: Service reps suck it's all Bout Ppl taking everything you have and more.

I called and of course, did not get an English speaking person.   They stated that they are getting caught up on the wrong billing issues they were having previously.   Not happy at all with PPL any longer.   They used to be the best, now they are the worst!!!!!!!!!!!   Do NOT recommend them at all.\\n\\nReview12: Review: Worse company ever.  They seems incompetent of fixing customer's problems and concerns. I haven't gotten a bill since January but yet still money are still being charged with no end cycle.

Don't ever send an email because it is not maintained or checked (a customer service representative advised)!!!! Our service was shut off so I called and it went to a call center in India. The rep said our documents were received and our electric would be turned back on shortly. Never turned on. Called the next day and the rep said the ID cannot be emailed it must be faxed or mailed. JOIN THE 21st CENTURY PPL!!! She then indicated it would only be 2 hours until it would be turned back on. Called back and spoke with a different person and they said that timeframe is wrong. After I faxed the document , I called back in an hour and they still had not confirmed they received anything !!  Are they working with dot matrix printers as well?!? WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!\\n\\nReview14: Review: The person in charge of customer service should be immediately terminated.  PP&L provides the absolute worst customer service of any company that I have dealt with in 50 years.  Ordered service on January 31, was turned on and two days later turned off.  Called again, waited 84 minutes for an agent, was told it was turned on immediately, it was not, called again, waited 91 minutes for an agent, was told it will be turned on, that day, it was not.  Called again, waited 72 minutes for an agent, was told it will be turned on tomorrow.  Now 6 days later still no service\\n\\nReview15: Review: Following a move to Pennsylvania (Poconos), I opened an account with PPL. Since I was a new customer I was told I would have to pay a security deposit of $444, but after one year of paying bills on time that money would be used toward future bills. Well it has been 14 months, with an excellent payment record and I keep getting billed. I've tried calling three times to remedy this and each time I have waited over 30 minutes on hold with no one answering. One other time a rep picked up in record time, but transferred me to Billing, where again I waited 30 minutes with no one answering.The only way to contact this company is by phone (really - 30 minutes waiting and no one picking up), or by letter.

One other time a rep picked up in record time, but transferred me to Billing, where again I waited 30 minutes with no one answering.The only way to contact this company is by phone (really - 30 minutes waiting and no one picking up), or by letter. In this day and age no contact via email.

Since I was a new customer I was told I would have to pay a security deposit of $444, but after one year of paying bills on time that money would be used toward future bills. Well it has been 14 months, with an excellent payment record and I keep getting billed. I've tried calling three times to remedy this and each time I have waited over 30 minutes on hold with no one answering. One other time a rep picked up in record time, but transferred me to Billing, where again I waited 30 minutes with no one answering.The only way to contact this company is by phone (really - 30 minutes waiting and no one picking up), or by letter. In this day and age no contact via email. Probably because there would be a record of how many people tried to reach them and how many times each person tried.I can't believe a public utility can be so inattentive and indifferent. My next move will be lodging a complaint with the BBB and the governor's office.\\nReview: Reading the prior reviews of this organization is mind-numbing, because they're not only just awful and likely shared by most of PPL's customers, but also because they clearly haven't cleaned up their act despite the rancor from their customers. This is the last place I should be reviewing a power service, but the utilities sector has completely hijacked the pandemic and has decided that its vulnerable customers, many who have been to struggle financially due to lockdowns, should take it up the keister.I've been a customer for over 15 years, and these previous reviews are all spot-on: terrible customer service, shocking bills, and frequent outages that, at least in my PA town, are never less than 8 hours, sometimes days. Their programs to help are insulting, inefficient, and you probably won't qualify in the first place.PPL's a monopoly, despite throwing a bone to smaller companies who are forced to use their equipment. I actually go with a third party company and dealing with them is far easier, but they don't have much hand. PPL has made, and will continue to make, out like the bandits they are during the toughest socioeconomic disaster in the history of the majority of their customers.\\nReview: Service reps suck it's all Bout Ppl taking everything you have and more. Charging late fees that are not late . They suck\\nReview: my  name is natasha edwards i worked here for four years and was wrongfully terminated today for system issues by angela iwasiak and she said i hung up on the customer when i was experiencing audio delays do not work here because she fires for no reason she is a bully and a bitch\\nReview: Allows their staff to call customers calling them a racist and allows their phone reps to harass call customers with threats to their voicemails\",\n",
